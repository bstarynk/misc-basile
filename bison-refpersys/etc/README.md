# bench.pl
A primitive Perl script to run benches.  Currently its only bench is the
usual calculator: it has a lightweight processing part (but not null), so it
is really emphasizing the cost of the whole parsing (including scanning and
I/O).

Set the envvars `BISON` and `CC` to the programs and flags you want to use.
They default to `bison` and `gcc`.  To run a non-installed bison from a
tarball built in _build, I suggest the following.

    BISON=_build/tests/bison CC='gcc -O2' ./bench.pl

(The `_build/tests/bison` wrapper makes sure that `_build/src/bison` will
use the tarballs' skeletons, not those already installed as a
straightforward use of `_build/src/bison` would.)
