                  semantic-aware version of the World Wide Web. The
                  availability of large-scale high quality domain
                  ontologies depends on effective and usable
                  methodologies aimed at supporting the crucial
                  process of ontology building. Ontology building
                  exhibits a structural and logical complexity that is
                  comparable to the production of software
                  artefacts. This paper proposes an ontology building
                  methodology that capitalizes the large experience
                  drawn from a widely used standard in software
                  engineering: the Unified Software Development
                  Process or Unified Process (UP). In particular, we
                  propose UP for ONtology (UPON) building, a
                  methodology for ontology building derived from the
                  UP. UPON is presented with the support of a
                  practical example in the eBusiness domain. A
                  comparative evaluation with other methodologies and
                  the results of its adoption in the context of the
                  Athena EU Integrated Project are also discussed."
