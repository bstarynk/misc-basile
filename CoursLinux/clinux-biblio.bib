                  coloring problem. Each node in the graph stands for
                  a computed quantity that resides in a machine
                  register, and two nodes are connected by an edge if
                  the quantities interfere with each other, that is,
                  if they are simultaneously live at some point in the
                  object program. This approach, though mentioned in
                  the literature, was never implemented
                  before. Preliminary results of an experimental
                  implementation in a PL/I optimizing compiler suggest
                  that global register allocation approaching that of
                  hand-coded assembly language may be attainable."
